# Overview

I have written a little math library to help people with their algebraic expressions!
This also helps with finding the area, perimeter, and volume of certain shapes!

# Development Environment

It depends on what operating software you have, but on mac it's linux with erlang installed and erlang, + erlang ls extensions in vs code. 

# Useful Websites

* [Erlang Documentation](https://www.erlang.org/docs)
* [Erlang - Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlang_(programming_language))

# Future Work

* Item 1, want to make it so it will save the variables into a database.
* Item 2, add functions to find the perimiter of certain shapes.
